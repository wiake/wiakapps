["wiak" is actually a team of four programmers at wiak.org (EDIT: site no longer online); so that identity is generally used in threads concerned with programming work in wiak to try and keep the general and the technical separated].

I must say that I agree with ttuuxxx about gtkdialog (with bash); I've always hated it. I much prefer C programming and a better GUI toolkit that doesn't leave processes running around out of control. gtkdialog is fine for only the simplest of apps (such as Pwget) but anything beyond that and it isn't quite so nice to program as it first seems... very messy.

Vala/Genie (C under the hood) indeed looks like a good way to go for low-bloat application/Puppy-utilities.

One of the 'products' of wiak team was called 'wiak', written in C in 2008, which:

"provides IPC (InterProcessCommunication) facilities (such as SysV message-passing queues) . . . to languages that don't have easy, flexible or any access to them (such as bash script). It also works well with the likes of gtkdialog to create event driven GUI or commandline user interfaces. . . . It is intended that wiak will eventually provide UNIX and INET socket capability
. . . [wiak] facilitates the creation of different clients for the same backend server(s), or indeed, different backend server(s) for the same GUI-client."

The wiak IPC program binary was also used in foksyfeyer dotpet addon for visually-impaired (or totally blind) users of Puppy linux in 2009.

The persona of mcewanw (aka William) requested forum moderator Flash, however, to close his murga-forum membership account in mid-2017 in an attempt to avoid further persistent trolling of some Puppy forum members. Now using team wiak login to complete some final development work for Puppy Linux.

What Is WIAK?
Wiak is a simple, limited, but very efficient, special-purpose, usually non-interactive, extremely lightweight IPC shell written in C.

WIAK stands for, the "WIAK Interface f√ºr Application Kontrolle". As an Inter-Process Communications utility, its name reflects its ability to create and control diverse wiakapps whose component parts may be written in a variety of programming languages and with an assortment of GUI toolkits.

Like most any program, wiak could be started up as the first main system application, after "init", on boot. However, wiak is more particularly of the family "shell" in that it can be used to start up (and in some cases control) other processes (or indeed other shells), whilst providing one or more IPC facilities for communicating between the running processes.

Compatible pipe-using commandline utilities and applications can be chained together, and called up and controlled, via wiak and a wiak compatible backend server, to produce a WIAK Application or "wiakapp".

In effect, wiak is thus a simple IPC subsystem which can be used to dynamically build a complex application by selection from a pool of individually functional parts. The resulting wiak-created-application, or wiakapp for short, is itself dynamic and temporary in shape and form, since wiak does not actually glue wiakapp component parts together. Instead, it creates through its message passing mechanism an illusion of virtual glue for what are otherwise unconnected processes.

Wiak encourages a client/server approach to programming, where, for example, the GUI component of the wiakapp can act as a client, sending simple commands and other data, via wiak, to a server application which itself might be a wrapper to a specific function or group of functions (e.g. GNU or UNIX commandline utilities).
